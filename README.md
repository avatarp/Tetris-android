## General info
This game was created as a project to pass an academic subject and also to teach myself how to use github. Later I put the emphasis on creating a tetris clone that suits me and could, for example, be released to the play store and not look bad at the same time.

Project is created using:
* MPAndroidChart v3.1 - https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart
